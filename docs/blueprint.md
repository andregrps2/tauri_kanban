## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to promote calmness and focus, reminiscent of clear skies.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), close to white, for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#63B5A3), offering a subtle contrast that provides gentle emphasis, as would a shadow on water.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headings and body text to provide a modern and clean look.
- Use simple, flat icons to represent actions such as adding a card, editing details, etc.
- A clean, card-based layout with clear visual separation between columns.
- Subtle animations when dragging and dropping cards between columns, like a smooth translation. No animation when a card enters or leaves a column; simply appear/disappear.
